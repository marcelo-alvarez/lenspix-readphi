# modified_lenspix
---modifications to LensPix by Louis Pham and Alex van Engelen ---

The original modifications can be found at [Louis Pham's github](https://github.com/louis-pham/modified_lenspix).

The original code for LensPix can be found [here](http://cosmologist.info/lenspix/).

## What does it do?
  Running lens.py will take the kappa (convergence) map and convert it to phi (gravitational potential) to be used as a lensing map. It will then read the nside and lmax of the primary map to be used in the lensing step. The script will then generate a "specific_params.ini" (created from the "generic_params.ini") based on the inputs provided. Lensing is simulated, and the lensed map is written to the provided filename. This will also yield a gradient phi map, and an unlensed and lensed power spectrum.

Much, if not all of the following assumes being used in a SciNet environment.

## Usage
To make the simlens program, simply go into the src/ folder and run the Makefile with the command "make". The "simlens" program should then be in the bin/ folder if all went well. Afterwards you should be able to run __lens.py__ properly.

This is the list of modules I had loaded for compiling to work:

On Niagara
  1) intel/2018.2       2) cfitsio/3.430
  3) anaconda2/5.1.0    4) intelmpi/2018.2

### Required files:
1. Unlensed TQU alm/map FITS file
2. Kappa map (combination of halo and field)

Run "__python lens.py <kappa_map_in> <primary_in> <phi_alm_out> <lensed_map_out> -np <no. of processes>__", where __<kappa_map_in>__ is the filename of the kappa map you want to lens with, __<primary_in>__ is the filename of the primary alm you want lensed, __<phi_alm_out>__ is the filename of the outputted phi alm, and __<lensed_map_out>__ is the filename for the lensed result. __<no. of processes>__ is the same as the __mpirun -np__ argument, since the code simply calls this command at the end. If -np is not provided it will default to 1. 

Here is a test command using the included test maps: __python lens.py test_maps/kappa_map.fits test_maps/primary_alm.fits test_maps/phi_trial.fits test_maps/lensed_trial.fits -np 8__

You may need to change the specific_params.ini path in the lens.py script (the "specificParams" variable) or any of the output file paths, such as when in a job environment and running the code from your home directory, since home becomes read-only.

An additional __make_maps.sh__ script has been added for batch lensing of multiple maps, which we used for CIB lensing simulations. If using this, make sure the __-np__ arguments agrees with the script's arguments (the comments at the beginning of the file). 

## Helper scripts
There are several helper scripts included. The main ones would be:
* kappa2phi.py
* analytic_sim_compare.py (in pycamb_scripts folder)
* makekappa.py
* makegif.py
* plotgrad.py
* shell_z_integrand.py
* shellcls.py

__kappa2phi.py__ is the script that does the conversion of the kappa map to phi alm.

__analytic_sim_compare.py__ is a script that allows one to compare the simulated lensed result with the analytical lensed calculations based on CAMB. To use, make sure you have pyCamb installed, and then provide the following in the script:
* primary alm filename
* phi alm filename
* lensed map filename

It will also need the theoretical power spectrum of the same maps used in Lenspix, which are:
* kappa power spectrum
* primary power spectrum

Finally, give a filename for the output from CAMB's convolution (the analytical lensed power spectrum). 

__makekappa.py__ was used in conjunction with analytic_sim_compare.py to take the correct power spectrum data from scalCls.dat or lenspotentialCls.dat and combine them with our own simulated kappa maps.

__makegif.py__ will take a set of CIB plots and combine them into a single animation.

__plotgrad.py__ will create a plot of the phi map with the gradients overplotted.

__shell_z_integrand.py__ takes the cl value of each CIB shell at l=500 and plots them.

__shellcls.py__ will plot the power spectra of the shells in one plot.

## Known issues
* lensing a map with many point sources will yield NaNs

## Todos
* different output lmax not yet implemented
* plotgrad.py randomly selects indices to plot arrows, need to come up with a cleaner solution
